# time period: 1998-01-01 - 1999-12-16
# 4632 input slowness-azimuth readings
# 305 bins populated with observations
# 2220 readings contributed to the corrections
# provisional default corrections:  sx: -3.576 , sy: -1.082
# azimuthal variance of default corrections: 65.245
# no global trend has been detected
# overall sdev of slowness residuals: 1.605
# overall sdev of  azimuth residuals: 75.934
# uncorrected bins, slowness residual sdev: 2.057
# uncorrected bins,  azimuth residual sdev: 85.063
# corrected bins, slowness residual sdev: 0.729
# corrected bins,  azimuth residual sdev: 11.845
#
# The corrections are determined for the bins on a circular grid
# defined by the slowness and azimuth intervals: [Slo,Shi),[Alo,Ahi).
# Grid definition file: /home/jinwang/NewSASC/grid/SASC.new.grid
#
# Only those corrections (i.e. median of observed slowness-azimuth residuals
# in a bin) are listed where the criteria for corrections were satisfied:
#    ( number of observations >= 10 && 
#      slowness residual std error <= 1.00 &&
#      azimuth residual std error <= 15.00 )
#
# A global trend is detected if at least 7.0% of bins are populated with
# observations and the azimuthal variance of corrections is less than 33.0.
# If a global trend exists in the corrections, a default correction
# is given for all detections. Further fine-tuning bin corrections are 
# applied to the detections in the bins defined in this file.
# In the lack of global trend the default corrections are set to zero and
# the default modeling error calculated only from the unbinned observations.

# Structure of the slowness-azimuth correction (SASC) table:
#    comment lines begin with '#'
#    line 1: Contains global slowness vector AFFINE transformation and the
#            slowness modeling error (azimuth modeling error is derived)
#       column 1: global slowness correction, x-component
#       column 2: global slowness correction, y-component
#       column 3: default slowness modeling error (sec/deg)
#       columns 4-7 are global rotation coefficients if the station have 
#           orientation error. They are derived from a seperate program and 
#           they are optional.
#    line 2: number of bins with correction (ncor)
#            (if only defaults are given the rest of this file remains empty)
#    line 3 - line ncor+2: bin corrections and modeling errors
#       column 1: bottom of slowness interval
#       column 2: top of slowness interval
#       column 3: bottom of azimuth interval
#       column 4: top of azimuth interval
#       column 5: slowness correction
#       column 6: azimuth correction
